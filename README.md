# FS17_T93_BulkSilo
Farming Simulator 17 mod. A silo from which you can buy fertilizer and seeds in bulk.

This silo can be placed anywhere on the map. It contains seeds and solid fertilizer. Both trailers (that can contain seeds or solid fertilizer) and tools (seeders or fertilizer spreaders) can be filled from it. Filling either will deduct the filled amount from the silo. The silo has a limited capacity. It is completely filled upon placement, and will be refilled to full capacity at midnight. Filling from this silo costs 10 percent less than buying bigbags (since you don't have to buy/lease the bigbags). Please check the specifications below to get more detailed information about the silo. This will probably change during the development process.

***WARNING***: You're looking at a development version of this mod. If you're not interested in developing, and simply want to play Farming Simulator with this mod, download it from [FS-UK](https://www.fs-uk.com/fs-mods/view/38647/Bulk-Silo-mod-for-fs-17). The code here might break your savegame, your computer, or your mind. 


## Features
### Specifications
- **Filltypes**: Seeds, Solid Fertilizer
- **Capacity**: 10.000L for each filltype
- **Bulk discount**: 10% (Default price Ã— 0.90)

### Manual
For later versions, there will be a better manual, if required.

Fill trailers below the spout, just like you fill at the silo at the farm.
Fill tools below the spout, just like you fill them near a bigbag. If you are precise enough with your seeder/fertilizer spreader, a particle effect will show. This has no effect on the price or filling speed of the silo, it is purely visual.

Drive or walk up to the silo to view how much seed/fertilizer is left in the silo. If your silo is empty, you can walk up to it and press "R" to instantly refill it. This is a temporary method, which will change.


### Version History
- **1.0.0.0** - Initial upload to FS-UK, bugs reported.
- **1.1.0.0** - Bugs fixed, feedback implemented.
    - l10n error
    - Concrete base under the silo
    - Being able to select which fillType to use when using a seeder that accepts both seeds and fertilizer.

### Roadmap
**Features:**
- Configurations when buying the silo. For example: Empty, 25% filled, 50%, 75%, 100%.
- Buyable capacity upgrades (possibly per filltype)
- Specify desired filllevel for midnight refill
- Possibly adding a liquid fertilizer fillTrigger as well
- Charge money when silo is filled. Currently still charges when filling a tool
- Add XML file for easy customization of settings like the bulk discount you get
- Add popup when trying to fill from empty silo / silo gets empty during filling
