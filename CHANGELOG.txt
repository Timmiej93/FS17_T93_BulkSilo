[Unreleased]
Fixed
	- Seed/Fert prices were incorrect (Using economyManager previously, now using manual prices that match the BigBags' price multiplied with the bulk discount)
	- Filling trailers was free, changed to use the same price as tools
	- Tools got filled as trailers after patch 1.4, now manually preventing this for constant results
	  + This also meant that the silo dialog popped up for filling tools, fixed now
